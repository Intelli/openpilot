## Installation
Please refer to [Recommended Branches](#recommended-branches) to find your preferred/supported branch. This guide will assume you want to install the latest `staging` branch.

### If you want to use our newest branches (our rewrite)
> [!TIP]
>You can see the rewrite state on our [rewrite project board](https://github.com/orgs/sunnypilot/projects/2), and to install the new branches, you can use the following links

* sunnypilot not installed or you installed a version before 0.8.17?
  1. [Factory reset/uninstall](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-reset-the-device) the previous software if you have another software/fork installed.
  2. After factory reset/uninstall and upon reboot, select `Custom Software` when given the option.
  3. Input the installation URL per [Recommended Branches](#recommended-branches). Example: ```https://staging.sunnypilot.ai```.
  4. Complete the rest of the installation following the onscreen instructions.

* sunnypilot already installed and you installed a version after 0.8.17?
  1. On the comma three/3X, go to `Settings` ▶️ `Software`.
  2. At the `Download` option, press `CHECK`. This will fetch the list of latest branches from sunnypilot.
  3. At the `Target Branch` option, press `SELECT` to open the Target Branch selector.
  4. Scroll to select the desired branch per  Recommended Branches (see below). Example: `staging`

### Recommended Branches
|      Branch     |                 Installation URL              |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| `release`       | `https://release.sunnypilot.ai`               |
| `staging`       | `https://staging.sunnypilot.ai`               |
|   `dev`         | `https://dev.sunnypilot.ai`                   |
| `custom-branch` | `https://install.sunnypilot.ai/{branch_name}` |

> [!TIP]
> You can use sunnypilot/targetbranch as an install URL. Example: 'sunnypilot/staging'.


### Branches

Running `master` and other branches directly is supported, but it's recommended to run one of the following prebuilt branches:

| comma four branch      | comma 3X branch        | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release-mici`         | `release-tizi`         | openpilot.comma.ai                     | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release-mici-staging` | `release-tizi-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`              | `nightly`              | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`          | `nightly-dev`          | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |
